# Back To Childhood

"Back To Childhood" is our very first project in our university life. It is actually a project of 2nd year 1st seamster's Java project. The project is about making some (actually 4) old game we used to play in childhood. Each game have online & offline version except Chur-Police ( reasons will be described later).

## Motivation

Reviving a childhood game that can be played on pc. It's funny & cool,isn't? Again, We can use properly the properties of OOP in this game and work with objects and deployed it in our project.

## How to play the online version

To play onlive version we have to run the Server.java file in one PC. After running we will get a ip adress. We will replace the ip adress with the ip adress in ConnectGame.java of each PC. There have some restrictions i.e. all the PCs have to under the same wifi.

## Description

All the four games are described shortly below:

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe**: It is one of the most popular and simple game of our childhood. We played this game in paper drawing lines making a 3X3 grid and each player will put cross and zero on the grid.

2. **Make-A-Box**: The game is played between 2 players, and it is played on a sheet of paper by drawing dots in the following manner. In each turn one player will connect 2 dots and make a line. If he can make a box, then the box will be named after him, and he have to give another move. The game is played until all the dots are connected. The winner of the game will be the person with having greater number of boxes.

3. **Chur-Police**: It is also a very popular game for childhood. This game is only for online. Because in offline version the Police can easily detect the Thief always that is one of the main twist of the game. So, offline version of this game no means here. The actual game is there have 4 piece of paper folded properly.Babu:1200, Chur:0, Police:500, Daroga:800. After properly shuffling randomly each player will get a card. The persons having 500(Police) and 1200(Babu) will reveal their card the other will keep their card secret. Then the police(having 500) will choose the chur(theif). If he failed to guess the chur then he will get 0 and the chur(having 0) will get 500. And this goes on and on....

4. **Snake-Ludo**: This game is played with dice. You know about this game. I am not describing this here.
